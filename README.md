Comments / Descriptions: The game ARCANE is a self playing game with adventurers and creatures in a cave system any number of rooms. The adventurers (adventurer, knight, coward, glutton) move rooms until they encounter a creature (creature or demon) and then they engage in a fight/flee/eat. The fight is determined by dice rolls made by both the creature and adventurer and continues until one of them dies. If the adventurers (knight, adventurer, coward) encounter food in a room without a creature, they are able to eat and increase their health.  

**Extra Notes**
We choose the adventurer that fights using the highest health which is done by sorting the adventurer list when we get the lists of adventurers/knights/cowards/gluttons. 

**Extra Credit Implementations**
- We implemented sequential distribution, it is part of our testPlayFullyConnectedGrid test.
- We also did fully connected rooms which are also part of that test.
