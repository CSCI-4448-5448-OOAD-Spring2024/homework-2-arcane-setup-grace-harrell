Comments / Descriptions: The game ARCANE is a self playing game with adventurers and creatures in a cave system any number of rooms. The adventurers (adventurer, knight, coward, glutton) move rooms until they encounter a creature (creature or demon) and then they engage in a fight/flee/eat. The fight is determined by dice rolls made by both the creature and adventurer and continues until one of them dies. If the adventurers (knight, adventurer, coward) encounter food in a room without a creature, they are able to eat and increase their health. We implemented an observer pattern to keep track of events such as an adventurers' or creatures' death, the end of a turn, the end of the game, etc. The adaptor pattern allows us to use the game display given to us.

**Extra Credit Implementation**
- We implemented a Cucumber-JVM scenario and the screenshot of the passing test is below.
