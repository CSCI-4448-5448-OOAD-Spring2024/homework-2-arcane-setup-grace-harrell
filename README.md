Comments / Descriptions: The game ARCANE is a self playing game with an adventurer and a creature in a cave system with 4 rooms. The adventurer moves rooms until it encounters the creature and then they engage in a fight. The fight is determined by dice rolls made by both the creature and adventurer and continues until one of them dies. (We have set up the game to take player input for the adventurer name, however, for the purposes of this project, we provide the system with mock input.)
