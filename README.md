Comments / Descriptions: The game ARCANE is a self playing game with adventurers and creatures in a cave system with 4 or 9 rooms. The adventurers move rooms until they encounter a creature and then they engage in a fight. The fight is determined by dice rolls made by both the creature and adventurer and continues until one of them dies. If the adventurers encounter food in a room without a creature, they are able to eat and increase their health.
